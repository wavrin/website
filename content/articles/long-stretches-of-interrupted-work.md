As someone who works from home, I have complete control over my working environment. This control is _the_ most beneficial feature of working from home. It allows me to achieve **long stretches of uninterrupted work**.

I can do no better work, accomplish no more difficult task, then when I’m doing so during a **long stretch of uninterrupted work**.

Your email inbox, or slack chat - or whatever it is you are continually being interrupted by - may be necessary for your work. But taking breaks from them will help you do focused work.
